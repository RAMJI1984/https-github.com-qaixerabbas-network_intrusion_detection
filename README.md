Codes for the paper entitled "Optimization of Predictive Performance of Intrusion Detection System Using Hybrid Ensemble Model for Secure Systems"

### Following datasets were used in this study.

- [The UNSW-NB15 Dataset](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset)
- [NSL-KDD dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)
- [CSE-CIC-IDS2018](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html)

### Following algorithms were studied individually and an ensemble of RF, SVM and MLP was used to develop a cost-effective and accurate model for Intrusion Detection.
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- kNN
- SVM
- MLP
- DNN
- CNN
- LSTM
- RNN

### Evaluation Methods
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

### Machine Specifications used for experimentation
- HP 840 G2 laptop
- Intel core i5 processor (5th generation)
- 64 bit Windows 10 operating system
- 16 GB RAM

### Note
These codes are obtained by downloading .py files from original jupyter notebooks. While reproducing the results make sure you run these codes in a separate Jupyter Notebook.

### Update
Codes for deep learning algorithms will be uploaded soon.
